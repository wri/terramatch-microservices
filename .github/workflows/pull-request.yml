# Note: we're disabling usage of NX Cloud. This does mean that all tests run every time, even
# if none of their dependent code changes, but it also means we don't have to pay for NX Cloud
# or go to NX Cloud to see test failures (they show on Github instead). If we get to a point
# where the full test suite is taking too long to run, we can explore paying for NX Cloud, but
# for now, this is fine.
